# 🎮 Game Jam Game Picker 🎮

Welcome to our **Game Jam Game Picker**! This tool helps us randomly select a game to build during our game jam week. After the week, we'll review and showcase each other's code! Let's have fun and build something amazing together! 🚀

## How It Works

1. **Selection Phase**: 
   - We start by randomly selecting a list of 10 classic games. 🎲
   - Both parties review the list and decide if they are happy with the selection. If not, we can roll for a new list! 🔄

2. **Voting Phase**: 
   - Once we agree on the list, we start the voting process by typing `Start` or `Go`. 🏁
   - Each person (Bob and Frank) gets 3 votes in each round to vote for their preferred games. 🗳️
   - Voting happens in two rounds:
     - **Round 1**: Vote for 3 games from the list of 10. 📜
     - **Round 2**: Vote for 3 games from a randomly selected subset of 3 games based on the weights from Round 1. 🎯

3. **Selection and Announcement**:
   - The game with the highest weight after Round 2 is selected as the game to build next. 🎉
   - The selected game is logged in this README with the date. 📝
