# 🎮 Game Jam Game Picker 🎮

Welcome to our **Game Jam Game Picker**! This tool helps us randomly select a game to build during our game jam week. After the week, we'll review and showcase each other's code! Let's have fun and build something amazing together! 🚀

## How It Works

1. **Selection Phase**: 
   - We start by randomly selecting a list of 10 classic games. 🎲
   - Both parties review the list and decide if they are happy with the selection. If not, we can roll for a new list! 🔄

2. **Voting Phase**: 
   - Once we agree on the list, we start the voting process by typing `Start` or `Go`. 🏁
   - Each person (Bob and Frank) gets 3 votes in each round to vote for their preferred games. 🗳️
   - Voting happens in two rounds:
     - **Round 1**: Vote for 3 games from the list of 10. 📜
     - **Round 2**: Vote for 3 games from a randomly selected subset of 3 games based on the weights from Round 1. 🎯

3. **Selection and Announcement**:
   - The game with the highest weight after Round 2 is selected as the game to build next. 🎉
   - The selected game is logged in this README with the date. 📝

Star Trader, released in 1974, is a classic trading simulation game where players immerse themselves in an interstellar economy. The game is set across various star systems, each with its own unique market conditions and resources.

In Star Trader, players start with a limited amount of capital and a basic spaceship. They must strategically decide which star systems to visit and which goods to trade. Each system has different prices for commodities like minerals, food, and technology, influenced by supply and demand dynamics. Players need to make informed decisions about when and where to buy low and sell high, all while managing the costs of travel and the risk of market fluctuations.

Key mechanics of Star Trader include resource management, strategic planning, and market analysis. Players must consider fuel consumption, ship maintenance, and potential encounters with space hazards or competitors. The game also features an evolving market, where prices change based on player actions and random events, adding a layer of unpredictability and requiring adaptive strategies.
